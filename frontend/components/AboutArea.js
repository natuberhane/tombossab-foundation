                                    Tombossa Dawit Negusse was a man of remarkable character, deeply respected for his unwavering commitment to family, entrepreneurship, and community service. His life story is one of resilience, compassion, and dedication, qualities that made him not only a successful individual but also an inspiring leader to those around him.
                                    Born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 1964,  to loving parents Tsegewein and Dawit Negusse,  his early life was shaped by strong family values and a sense of duty to others. At a young age, his family returned to their homeland of Asmara, Eritrea, where these values were deeply ingrained through close family ties and the importance of hard work and education.
                                    </p><p className="section__desc">
                                    As a teenager, Tombossa and his family - 5 siblings with their parents - were forced to flee the turmoil of war in Eritrea, first moving to Sudan and eventually settling in Oklahoma, USA. This journey, driven by the pursuit of safety and a better future, was a defining moment in Tombossa's life, highlighting his resilience in the face of adversity. In Oklahoma, Tombossa thrived academically, completing high school, college, and postgraduate studies despite the challenges of displacement.
                                    </p><p className="section__desc">
                                    Initially pursuing a master's degree in agricultural engineering at Oklahoma State University, Tombossa’s academic path reflected his diverse interests and intellect. Yet, even during his early studies, his entrepreneurial spirit shined through. His deep connection to Eritrea remained at the forefront of his ambitions, and after completing his education, Tombossa took a pivotal year to support his homeland. He worked alongside Eritrean freedom fighters, a period that profoundly shaped his character, instilling in him a lasting wisdom and a commitment to social and economic development.

                                    It was upon his return to the United States that Tombossa’s life took a new turn—one that would shape his personal happiness and future. In Dallas, Texas, he met the love of his life, Bibi, in what seemed like a fateful encounter at a hair salon. Their connection was immediate and deep, leading to a year of dating that only strengthened their bond. Their love story culminated in a proposal during a family visit to Asmara, followed by a wedding in Eritrea. Together, they built a life centered on love, family, and shared dreams. Tombossa and Bibi raised three beautiful children—Noel, Milena, and Ariana—who are the pride and joys of their lives.

                                    While Tombossa found success in the United States, his heart never left Eritrea. His early work in agriculture demonstrated his commitment to using his skills for the betterment of his homeland, cultivating productive fruit farms amidst the difficult conditions of war. However, the ongoing conflict in Eritrea ultimately led him back to Dallas, where he shifted his focus to entrepreneurship. In the United States, Tombossa achieved significant success in retail and real estate, establishing businesses that allowed him to retire early and focus on what mattered most—his family and their future.

They shared a passion for uplifting others and believed that the power of education could transform lives and communities.
